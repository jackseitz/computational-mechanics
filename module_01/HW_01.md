# Homework

## Problems [Part 1](./01_Interacting_with_Python.md)

1. Calculate some properties of a rectangular box that is 12.5"$\times$11"$\times$14" and weighs 31 lbs

    a. What is the volume of the box?
    
    b. What is the average density of the box?
    
    c. What is the result of the following logical operation, `volume>1000` (in inches^3)

```{code-cell} ipython3
volume = 12.5*11*14
print(volume)

mass = 31
avg_density = mass/volume
print(avg_density)

print(volume>1000)
#the operation returns True, as the volume of the box is greater than 1000 in^3
#if the volume was lass than 1000 in^3, the operation would have returned false
```

2. Use the variables given below, `str1` and `str2`, and check the following 

    a. `str1<str2`
    
    b. `str1==str2`
    
    c. `str1>str2`
    
    d. How could you force (b) to be true? [Hint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str.lower#str.lower) or [Hint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str.lower#str.upper)

```{code-cell} ipython3
str1 = 'Python'
str2 = 'python'

print(str1<str2)
#returns true, as lower case 'p' has a greater value than upper case 'P' in ASCII/Unicode
print(str1 == str2)
#returns false, following the same reason as above
print(str1>str2)
#returns false, following the same reason as above

#to force b) to be true, we can change both strings to be all capital letters using the .upper() operand
#we can change them to all lower case just as easily with .lower()
str1 = str1.upper()
str2 = str2.upper()

print(str1 == str2)
```

3. The following code has an error, fix the error so that the correct result is returned:

```y is 20 and x is less than y```

```python
x="1"
y=20

if x<y and y==20:
    print('y is 20 and x is less than y')
else:
    print('x is not less than y')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
x=1 #the quotation marks were removed here from '1', as it caused us to be comparing two different types (int vs str)
y=20

if x<y and y==20:
    print('y is 20 and x is less than y')
else:
    print('x is not less than y')
```

4. There is a commonly-used programming question that asks interviewees
   to build a [fizz-buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) result. 
   
   Here, you will build a similar program, but use the numbers from the
   class, **3255:** $3,~2,~5\rightarrow$ "computational", "mechanics",
   "rocks!". You should print out a list of numbers, if the number is
   divisible by 3, replace the 3 with "computational". If the number is
   divisible by 2, replace with "mechanics". If the number is divisible
   by 5, replace the number with "rocks!". If the number is divisible by
   a combination, then add both words e.g. 6 is divisible by 3 and 2, so
   you would print out "computational mechanics". 
   
   Here are the first 20 outputs your program should print, 
   
| index | printed output |
| ---   | ---            |
0 | Computational Mechanics Rocks!
1 | 1
2 | Mechanics 
3 | Computational 
4 | Mechanics 
5 | Rocks!
6 | Computational Mechanics
7 | 7
8 | Mechanics 
9 | Computational 
10 | Mechanics Rocks!
11 | 11
12 | Computational Mechanics
13 | 13
14 | Mechanics 
15 | Computational Rocks!
16 | Mechanics 
17 | 17
18 | Computational Mechanics
19 | 19

```{code-cell} ipython3
message = "Computational Mechanics Rocks!"
words = message.split(" ")
i = 0

for i in range(20):
    
    if (i%3==0) and (i%2==0) and (i%5==0):
        print(words[0] + ' ' + words[1] + ' ' + words[2])
        
    elif (i%3==0) and (i%2==0):
        print(words[0] + ' ' + words[1])
        
    elif (i%2==0) and (i%5==0):
        print(words[1] + ' ' + words[2])
        
    elif (i%3==0) and (i%5==0):
        print(words[0] + ' ' + words[2])
    
    elif i%3 == 0:
        print(words[0])
        
    elif i%2 == 0:
        print(words[1])
        
    elif i%5 == 0:
        print(words[2])
        
    else:
        print(i)
        
    i = ++i
```

## Problems [Part 2](./02_Working_with_Python.md)

1. Create a function called `sincos(x)` that returns two arrays, `sinx` and `cosx` that return the sine and cosine of the input array, `x`. 

    a. Document your function with a help file in `'''help'''`
    
    b. Use your function to plot sin(x) and cos(x) for x=$0..2\pi$

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def sincos(x):
    sinx = np.sin(x)
    cosx = np.cos(x)
    
    plt.plot(x, sinx)
    plt.plot(x, cosx)
    
    plt.show()
    
    return sinx, cosx

input_arr = np.array([0*np.pi, 1*np.pi, 2*np.pi])

sincos(input_arr)

'''The function takes in an array of numbers given by 'input_arr'. The function then takes the array and finds the sin and cos values for each value in the array, and these new values are then plotted. The function displays the plots, and returns the values that are calculated. '''
```

2. Use a for-loop to create a variable called `A_99`, where every element is the product
of the two indices from 0 to 9 e.g. A_99[3,2]=6 and A_99[4,4]=16. 

    
a. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of `A_99`

b. time your script that creates `A_99` takes its mean and standard deviation using `%%timeit`

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time

def create_A_99():
    A_99 = np.zeros((10, 10))
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            A_99[i, j] = i * j
    return A_99

A_99 = create_A_99()

simplified_mean = sum(A_99)/len(A_99)
mean = sum(simplified_mean)/len(simplified_mean)
print(mean)

simplified_var = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in A_99) / len(A_99)
var = sum(simplified_var)/len(simplified_var)
std_dev = var ** 0.5
print(std_dev)
```

3. Use the two arrays, X and Y, given below to create A_99 using numpy array math rather than a for-loop.

```{code-cell} ipython3
X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(10), np.arange(10))
```

b. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of `A_99`

c. time your script that creates `A_99` takes its mean and standard deviation using `%%timeit`    
    
d. create a filled contour plot of X, Y, A_99 [contourf plot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.contourf.html)

```{code-cell} ipython3
X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(10), np.arange(10))
A_99 = X * Y

mean = np.mean(A_99)
print(mean)

std_dev = np.std(A_99)
print(std_dev)

plt.figure()
contour = plt.contourf(X, Y, A_99)
plt.colorbar(contour)
plt.title('Filled Contour Plot of A_99')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
```

4. The following linear interpolation function has an error. It is supposed to return y(x) given the the two points $p_1=[x_1,~y_1]$ and $p_2=[x_2,~y_2]$. Currently, it just returns and error.

```python
def linInterp(x,p1,p2):
    '''linear interplation function
    return y(x) given the two endpoints 
    p1=np.array([x1,y1])
    and
    p2=np.array([x2,y2])'''
    slope = (p2[2]-p1[2])/(p2[1]-p1[1])
    
    return p1[2]+slope*(x - p1[1])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def linInterp(x,p1,p2):
    '''linear interplation function
    return y(x) given the two endpoints 
    p1=np.array([x1,y1])
    and
    p2=np.array([x2,y2])'''
    slope = (p2[1]-p1[1])/(p2[0]-p1[0]) #must be calculating between 1 and 0, 2 would be out of bounds

    return p1[1]+slope*(x - p1[0]) #based on changing the above, we change the items to be 1 and 0, respectively, rather than 2 and 1
```

## Problems [Part 3](03_Numerical_error.md)

1. The growth of populations of organisms has many engineering and scientific applications. One of the simplest
models assumes that the rate of change of the population p is proportional to the existing population at any time t:

$\frac{dp}{dt} = k_g p$

where $t$ is time in years, and $k_g$ is growth rate in \[1/years\]. 

The world population has been increasing dramatically, let's make a prediction based upon the [following data](https://worldpopulationhistory.org/map/2020/mercator/1/0/25/) saved in [world_population_1900-2020.csv](../data/world_population_1900-2020.csv):


|year| world population |
|---|---|
|1900|1,578,000,000|
|1950|2,526,000,000|
|2000|6,127,000,000|
|2020|7,795,482,000|

a. Use a growth rate of $k_g=0.013$ [1/years] and compare the analytical solution (use initial condition p(1900) = 1578000000) to the Euler integration for time steps of 20 years from 1900 to 2020 (Hint: use method (1)- plot the two solutions together with the given data) 

b. Discussion question: If you decrease the time steps further and the solution converges, will it converge to the actual world population? Why or why not? 

**Note: We have used a new function `np.loadtxt` here. Use the `help` or `?` to learn about what this function does and how the arguments can change the output. In the next module, we will go into more details on how to load data, plot data, and present trends.**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
year, pop = np.loadtxt('../data/world_population_1900-2020.csv',skiprows=1,delimiter=',',unpack=True)
print('years=',year)
print('population =', pop)

kg = 0.013

#analytical solution function
def analytical_solution(t, P0, k):
    return P0 * np.exp(k * (t - year[0]))

#euler integration method function
def euler_integration(P0, k, t_steps):
    populations = [P0]
    for i in range(1, len(t_steps)):
        dt = t_steps[i] - t_steps[i-1]
        populations.append(populations[-1] + k * populations[-1] * dt)
    return np.array(populations)

#time steps for Euler integration
time_steps = np.arange(year[0], year[-1] + 1, 20)

#calculate populations using Euler integration
euler_populations = euler_integration(pop[0], kg, time_steps)

#calculate populations using the analytical solution
analytical_populations = analytical_solution(time_steps, pop[0], kg)

#plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(year, pop, 'ro', label='Historical Data')
plt.plot(time_steps, euler_populations, 'b-', label='Euler Integration')
plt.plot(time_steps, analytical_populations, 'g--', label='Analytical Solution')

plt.title('World Population Growth Model')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('World Population')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print('average population changes 1900-1950, 1950-2000, 2000-2020')
print((pop[1:] - pop[0:-1])/(year[1:] - year[0:-1]))
print('average growth of 1900 - 2020')
print(np.mean((pop[1:] - pop[0:-1])/(year[1:] - year[0:-1])))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
'''if we decrease the time steps, the Euler integration will produce a solution that is closer to the analytical solution because the error per step decreases with smaller steps. however, the model will not converge to the actual world population because it is a simple model that does not account for the complexity of factors influencing population growth.'''
```

__d.__ What happens to the numerical model as the number of timesteps increases? Does it look more like the analytical curve, $e^k(t-1900)$, or the measured population data, `pop`?

```{code-cell} ipython3
'''As the number of timesteps increases, the numerical solution becomes more accurate and tends to converge towards the analytical solution. This happens because Euler's method approximates the solution by taking finite steps, and as those steps become smaller (with an increase in the number of timesteps), the approximation becomes more precise.'''
```

2. In the freefall example you used smaller time steps to decrease the **truncation error** in our Euler approximation. Another way to decrease approximation error is to continue expanding the Taylor series. Consider the function f(x)

    $f(x)=e^x = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+...$

    We can approximate $e^x$ as $1+x$ (first order), $1+x+x^2/2$ (second order), and so on each higher order results in smaller error. 
    
    a. Use the given `exptaylor` function to approximate the value of exp(1) with a second-order Taylor series expansion. What is the relative error compared to `np.exp(1)`?
    
    b. Time the solution for a second-order Taylor series and a tenth-order Taylor series using `%%timeit`. How long would a 100,000-order series take (approximate this, **DON'T RUN** `exptaylor(1, 1000000)` )
    
    c. Plot the relative error as a function of the Taylor series expansion order from first order upwards. (Hint: use method (4) in the comparison methods from the "Truncation and roundoff error accumulation in log-log plot" figure)

```{code-cell} ipython3
from math import factorial
def exptaylor(x,n):
    '''Taylor series expansion about x=0 for the function e^x
    the full expansion follows the function
    e^x = 1+ x + x**2/2! + x**3/3! + x**4/4! + x**5/5! +...'''
    if n<1:
        print('lowest order expansion is 0 where e^x = 1')
        return 1
    else:
        ex = 1+x # define the first-order taylor series result
        for i in range(1,n):
            ex+=x**(i+1)/factorial(i+1) # add the nth-order result for each step in loop
        return ex
        
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import timeit

def time_second_order():
    return exptaylor(1, 2)

def time_tenth_order():
    return exptaylor(1, 10)

# timing the functions
time_second_order_duration = timeit.timeit(time_second_order, number=1000)
time_tenth_order_duration = timeit.timeit(time_tenth_order, number=1000)

# calculate the average time per run for both cases
average_time_second_order = time_second_order_duration / 1000
average_time_tenth_order = time_tenth_order_duration / 1000

# estimate the time for a 100,000-order series
# this is a simple estimate, real performance may vary due to computational complexity
estimate_100k_order = (average_time_tenth_order / 10) * 100000

print(estimate_100k_orde)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# calculate the relative error for Taylor series expansions from 1st to 10th order
orders = np.arange(1, 11)
relative_errors = []
true_value = np.exp(1)

for n in orders:
    approximation = exptaylor(x, n)
    relative_error = abs(approximation - true_value) / true_value
    relative_errors.append(relative_error)

# plot the relative error on a log-log scale
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.loglog(orders, relative_errors, 'bo-', basex=10, basey=10)
plt.xlabel('Order of Taylor Series Expansion')
plt.ylabel('Relative Error')
plt.title('Relative Error of Taylor Series Approximation of e')
plt.grid(True, which="both", ls="--")
plt.show()
```
